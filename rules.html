    <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
    <p>Below are the rules of how to play Ritual TTRPG. Remember, as a role playing game, nothing is more important than your imagination and no personal change or addition to these rules is off-limits at the table if it will make your party's experience more enjoyable.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Auran</h2>
    <p>Aurans are the gods of the world of Ritual, and masters of mortal fate. Similar to the dungeon or game master of other games, one player of Ritual will always be set aside to manage the world and non-player characters (NPCs) that the other players, called the Fatebound, interact with. In Ritual, this person is called The Auran. For all matters of story, mechanics, judgment, and direction, The Auran's word is final. They are not intended to be an enemy to the Fatebound, but a key facilitator in allowing the story of Ritual to come to life in an organic and fun way while minimizing disagreements and confusion at the play table.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Aurans decide the details of towns, wilderness, ancient ruins, and everything in between. They can use monsters straight from the bestiary to attack the Fatebound, modify them, or invent their own. They can make NPCs that assist players, pose as obstacles, or offer quests. The purpose of this freedom is to stop Ritual from becoming, contrary to the name, overly ritualistic. The game should remain fresh for both the Auran and the Fatebound as they explore together.</p>
    <h2>Building a Character</h2>
    <p>Unlike The Auran, who builds and maintains a Ritual world, players interact with it through the lens of a character they create. Characters are people with special powers compared to ordinary folk, but nonetheless fit naturally into the structure of Ritual and its environment. Players are intended to give their characters personality, quirks, and ambitions, then identify with them as they use them to explore the world of Ritual. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Players differentiate their characters from each other first by means of giving them a name, a backstory, and a personality. Not all people in the world of Ritual are the same however, and there will be mechanical differences from character to character. These differences are represented principally by attributes, classes and subclasses, and equipment. The detailed rules regarding these differences can be found later in the rules as well as explored in the character creation tool.</p>
