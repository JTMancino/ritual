    <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
    <p>Below are the rules of how to play Ritual TTRPG. Remember, as a role playing game, nothing is more important than your imagination and no personal change or addition to these rules is off-limits at the table if it will make your party's experience more enjoyable.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Auran</h2>
    <p>1.1 Aurans are the gods of the world of Ritual, and masters of mortal fate. Similar to the dungeon or game master of other games, one player of Ritual will always be set aside to manage the world and non-player characters (NPCs) that the other players, called the Fatebound, interact with. In Ritual, this person is called The Auran. For all matters of story, mechanics, judgment, and direction, The Auran's word is final. They are not intended to be an enemy to the Fatebound, but a key facilitator in allowing the story of Ritual to come to life in an organic and fun way while minimizing disagreements and confusion at the play table.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>1.2 Aurans decide the details of towns, wilderness, ancient ruins, and everything in between. They can use monsters straight from the bestiary to attack the Fatebound, modify them, or invent their own. They can make NPCs that assist players, pose as obstacles, or offer quests. The purpose of this freedom is to stop Ritual from becoming, contrary to the name, overly ritualistic. The game should remain fresh for both the Auran and the Fatebound as they explore together.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Building a Character</h2>
    <p>2.1 Unlike The Auran, who builds and maintains a Ritual world, players interact with it through the lens of a character they create. Characters are people with special powers compared to ordinary folk, but nonetheless fit naturally into the structure of Ritual and its environment. Players are intended to give their characters personality, quirks, and ambitions, then identify with them as they use them to explore the world of Ritual. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>2.2 Players differentiate their characters from each other first by means of giving them a name, a backstory, and a personality. Not all people in the world of Ritual are the same however, and there will be mechanical differences from character to character. These differences are represented principally by attributes, classes and subclasses, and equipment. The detailed rules regarding these differences can be found later in the rules as well as explored in the character creation tool.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>2.3 The following is a table of superclasses (arcanist, frontiersman, soldier) and their subclasses.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Arcanist</th>
            <th>Frontiersman</th>
            <th>Soldier</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Artificer</td>
            <td>Deputy</td>
            <td>Crusader</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Druid</td>
            <td>Outlaw</td>
            <td>Geurilla</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Evoker</td>
            <td>Physician</td>
            <td>Grenadier</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mystic</td>
            <td>Ranger</td>
            <td>Witch Hunter</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>These classes each represent a path of expertise a given character may go down in the course of their adventuring lives. Arcanists are the rare few who can speak the language of the gods, Auran, and therefore possess magical power. Frontiersman are hardy and rugged adventurers, who know an oppurtunity when they see one and rarely flinch from danger. Soldiers are dominators on the battlefield, wielding heavy arms and armor to protect their allies and slay their enemies. It is reccomended to develop a character concept first, then ask yourself which superclass and subclass best fits the character you envisioned yourself playing.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>2.4 At level one, players start with 1d4 + 3 hit points. A hit point is a measure of health, which will decrease when something takes damage. If a creature or object reaches zero hitpoints, it dies or is destroyed. Be careful! Fatebound may get far more powerful as their levels increase, but their mortality does not change. Each character has a set of attributes, and a pool of attribute points to spend at character creation. You receive fifty points to distribute as you please between brawn, charisma, dexterity, intellect*, and willpower. These traits have no direct impact on routine aspects of the game, but their relevance arises either in connection to effects with reference them or during special events called Auran trials, as explained in rule 2.5. For example, an outlaw frontiersman who just killed an giant may go to pick up his hammer, only to find it requires a brawn of seventy five to properly wield, or an artificer arcanist may find themselves lucky enough to notice a hidden door that requires an intellect of thirty to perceive. Finally, there are focus points. Focus points are a resource which some classes need to manage, and are derived from intellect. Every character has at least one maximum focus, which is increased by their intellect ability divided by ten and rounded to the nearest integer. This makes intellect distinct from other ability scores, as for some characters it may have a more direct impact on the game.</p> 
      <hr>
      <p>2.5 Auran trials are challenges which require a throw of some number of dice decided by The Auran. The aim is for Fatebound to roll a number below their ability score, and there will be consequences for passing or failing the roll. For example, The Auran may tell each Fatebound to roll 3d6 against their brawn to swim to shore from a sinking ship. The crusader with a brawn of twenty will pass automatically, because 3d6 cannot total higher than his brawn score. On the other hand, the physician with a brawn of five will need to roll exceptionally low in order to pass. For most characters it will be impossible for an ability score to exceed 100, so in the special case of a 1d100 Auran trial, the player may consider their ability score equal to a percent chance of passing the trial. All base scores are increased by one for each level, so even with no investment in a given ability, an average level ten character will have a ten percent chance at passing a 1d100 Auran trial in that ability. Generally speaking, Auran trials will only be used to test for success under duress or for feats of great difficulty. Even a very weak Fatebound will have no trouble opening an unlocked door or noticing a shining golden throne.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Levels and Classes</h2>
      <p>3.1 A character's level is an abstract way to represent their skill, strength, and experience gained by adventuring. Characters begin at level one unless directed otherwise by The Auran, and The Auran decides when characters can increase in level. It is generally reccomended that all players of a given party increase in level at the same time to ensure a balanced play experience. At level one, Fatebound characters choose a class which they will stick with. Each class, arcanist, frontiersman, and soldier, offer unique benefits and grow more powerful as levels increase. Here is a table of those superclass benefits by level.</p>

            <td>You can communicate in Auran, the language of the gods. This language of creation imparts a fraction of their power to you, allowing you to change the nature of the world. You can use an action to read Auran scrolls to cast a spell inscribed upon one. This will destroy the scroll, but in exchange trigger a magnificent effect.</td>
            <td>You have a steady eye, and a steady hand. After years of honing your craft's precision, you know just how to land a hit. When your unmodified attack roll is 90 or higher, your attack lands in a critical spot and deals double damage to its target. In addition, you are proficient in the use of all light armors.</td>
            <td>You are a battle hardened warrior whose presence dominates the front line of combat. You are proficient in all light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as melee weapons and shields.

Some magical items may be protected against such tinkering.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Master artificers can perform far more than basic enchantments. If an artificer of this level dedicates a full 24 hours of study to an enchanted item, they may learn to replicate its enchantment in a similar way to their basic improvements.</td>
