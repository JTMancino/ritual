    <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
    <p>Below are the rules of how to play Ritual TTRPG. Remember, as a role playing game, nothing is more important than your imagination and no personal change or addition to these rules is off-limits at the table if it will make your party's experience more enjoyable.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Auran</h2>
    <p>1.1 Aurans are the gods of the world of Ritual, and masters of mortal fate. Similar to the dungeon or game master of other games, one player of Ritual will always be set aside to manage the world and non-player characters (NPCs) that the other players, called the Fatebound, interact with. In Ritual, this person is called The Auran. For all matters of story, mechanics, judgment, and direction, The Auran's word is final. They are not intended to be an enemy to the Fatebound, but a key facilitator in allowing the story of Ritual to come to life in an organic and fun way while minimizing disagreements and confusion at the play table.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>1.2 Aurans decide the details of towns, wilderness, ancient ruins, and everything in between. They can use monsters straight from the bestiary to attack the Fatebound, modify them, or invent their own. They can make NPCs that assist players, pose as obstacles, or offer quests. The purpose of this freedom is to stop Ritual from becoming, contrary to the name, overly ritualistic. The game should remain fresh for both the Auran and the Fatebound as they explore together.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Building a Character</h2>
    <p>2.1 Unlike The Auran, who builds and maintains a Ritual world, players interact with it through the lens of a character they create. Characters are people with special powers compared to ordinary folk, but nonetheless fit naturally into the structure of Ritual and its environment. Players are intended to give their characters personality, quirks, and ambitions, then identify with them as they use them to explore the world of Ritual. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>2.2 Players differentiate their characters from each other first by means of giving them a name, a backstory, and a personality. Not all people in the world of Ritual are the same however, and there will be mechanical differences from character to character. These differences are represented principally by attributes, classes and subclasses, and equipment. The detailed rules regarding these differences can be found later in the rules as well as explored in the character creation tool.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>2.3 The following is a table of superclasses (arcanist, frontiersman, soldier) and their subclasses.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Arcanist</th>
            <th>Frontiersman</th>
            <th>Soldier</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Artificer</td>
            <td>Deputy</td>
            <td>Crusader</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Druid</td>
            <td>Outlaw</td>
            <td>Guerilla</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Evoker</td>
            <td>Physician</td>
            <td>Grenadier</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mystic</td>
            <td>Ranger</td>
            <td>Witch Hunter</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>These classes each represent a path of expertise a given character may go down in the course of their adventuring lives. Arcanists are the rare few who can speak the language of the gods, Auran, and therefore possess magical power. Frontiersman are hardy and rugged adventurers, who know an oppurtunity when they see one and rarely flinch from danger. Soldiers are dominators on the battlefield, wielding heavy arms and armor to protect their allies and slay their enemies. It is reccomended to develop a character concept first, then ask yourself which superclass and subclass best fits the character you envisioned yourself playing.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>2.4 At level one, players start with 1d4 + 3 hit points. A hit point is a measure of health, which will decrease when something takes damage as described in chapter 4.5. If most creatures or objects reach zero hitpoints, they die or are destroyed. Be careful! Fatebound may get far more powerful as their levels increase, but their mortality does not change. Each character has a set of attributes, and a pool of attribute points to spend at character creation. You receive 100 points to distribute as you please between brawn, charisma, dexterity, intellect, and willpower. These traits have no direct impact on routine aspects of the game, but their relevance arises either in connection to effects with reference them or during special events called Auran trials, as explained in rule 2.5. For example, an outlaw frontiersman who just killed an giant may go to pick up his hammer, only to find it requires a brawn of seventy five to properly wield, or an artificer arcanist may find themselves lucky enough to notice a hidden door that requires an intellect of thirty to perceive. Finally, there are focus points. Focus points are a resource which some classes need to manage, and each character has a base of three maximum points. Every character has a base of three maximum focus, which may be modified by some effects and abilities to a minimum of one.</p> 
      <hr>
      <p>2.5 Auran trials are challenges which require a throw of some number of dice decided by The Auran. The aim is for Fatebound to roll a number below their ability score, and there will be consequences for passing or failing the roll. For example, The Auran may tell each Fatebound to roll 3d6 against their brawn to swim to shore from a sinking ship. The crusader with a brawn of twenty will pass automatically, because 3d6 cannot total higher than his brawn score. On the other hand, the physician with a brawn of five will need to roll exceptionally low in order to pass. For most characters it will be impossible for an ability score to exceed 100, so in the special case of a 1d100 Auran trial, the player may consider their ability score equal to a percent chance of passing the trial. All base scores are increased by one for each level, so even with no investment in a given ability, an average level ten character will have a ten percent chance at passing a 1d100 Auran trial in that ability. Generally speaking, Auran trials will only be used to test for success under duress or for feats of great difficulty. Even a very weak Fatebound will have no trouble opening an unlocked door or noticing a shining golden throne.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Races, Levels and Classes</h2>
      <p>3.1 A character's level is an abstract way to represent their skill, strength, and experience gained by adventuring. Characters begin at level one unless directed otherwise by The Auran, and The Auran decides when characters can increase in level. It is generally reccomended that all players of a given party increase in level at the same time to ensure a balanced play experience. In addition to increasing progression of a class when leveling up, players may distribute an additional ten attribute points to a maximum of 100 in each attribute. At level one, Fatebound characters choose a class which they will stick with. Each class, arcanist, frontiersman, and soldier, offer unique benefits and grow more powerful as levels increase. At subsequent levels, players can progress in the same or a different class. Here is a table of those superclass benefits by level.</p>

Some magical items may be protected against such tinkering.</td>

They are the most populous and most colonial of all races, and their presence sprawls across the entire world of ritual. They form massive towns and cities which are sometimes sustained by as many as a dozen rituals of all different types and cultures.</td>
            <td>Earthspawn are a humanoid people who live together in tightly knit mountain fortress communities, which can be distrustful of outsiders. Their skin is made of gleaming bronze, and when there is a light source nearby they emit a soft reflective glow. They often adorn themselves with jewels and rare metals from the Earth where they live, and once they initiate a ritual they take pride in continuously sustaining it for generations.</td>
            <td>Seaspawn are long lived amphibious humanoids who populate the oceans, though they can survive just as easily on land and a rare few do venture up. Their culture has been allowed to develop safe from other races, and without war or old age, have developed a thriving culture of arts and sciences. Most population centers under the sea employ very weak rituals, if any, because the water naturally protects them from danger</td>
            <td>Skyspawn are nomadic winged humanoids with the appearance of angels who move together in nomadic tribes. Skyspawn tribes must recreate their rituals each time they move, so many tribes have a very high number of arcanists that can help rebuild it daily. Some tribes actually speak Auran as a primary language.</td>
            <td>Flamespawn are animated humanoid golems made from still glowing embers and coal. They do not reproduce in the traditional sense, but they spring into existence out from the ash at the center of massive wildfires. Some fire siblings, who emerge from the heart of the same flame, build primitive shelters and live together where they were born. Their rituals involve lighting renewable fires, scattering the ashes to fertilize new life. Others travel to nearby towns and cities, or strike out entirely on their own, guided by instinct and the lessons imparted by whatever spirit possessed them.</td>

      <h2>Actions and Combat</h2>
      <p>4.1 Your character's decisions in Ritual are incredibly freeform for most of the game, but combat offers more structure. Time is divided into turns, where creatures alternate taking actions, of a five second span. Each creature can take up to three actions during their turn, and there are base actions shared by all creatures then special actions defined by classes, subclasses, items, or The Auran. See the common actions below.</p>

            <td>Roll 1d100, and compare the number to the target's armor rating. If you rolled above the armor rating (or scored a critical hit as a frontiersman) you damage the target for an amount determined by the weapon. Unarmed strikes do one damage unless stated otherwise. Some weapons have ranges, and almost all will modify the attack action in some way. Ranged attacks against enemies in melee range treat that enemy as if they have twenty additional armor.</td>

            <td>You walk, run, or sprint in any direction. Some terrain is impeding, and will therefore halve your movement speed, other effects or abilities may increase the speed as well, but the standard movement speed of a Fatebound is 25 feet per five seconds.</td>

      <p>4.2 Armor is a measure of how likely a creature is to be hit. The base armor of a Fatebound is thirty, meaning there is a 30% chance that they will be hit by a creature targeting them. This number can be increased by abilities and items, but can never exceed 90 for Fatebound or NPCs unless specifically overruled by The Auran.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Hit points are a measure of a creatures health. Damage reduces the current hit points from a pool up to the maximum, and when any damage occurs on a creature with zero hit points remaining a scar will form. For unimportant NPCs, a scar will typically mean instant death. For Fatebound and legendary NPCs however, up to three scars may be accrued before a hit becomes fatal. The fourth scar will kill you instantly. When you get a scar, roll 1d12. Consult the table below to see what kind will form. Hitpoints cannot go negative, and once your hitpoints are brought to zero you only need to track sources of damage, not quantity.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>4.3 To determine the turn order in combat, The Auran will call for an iniative roll. Each creature in the vicinity will roll 1d100, and combat will progress from the creature with the highest to the lowest roll. Some abilities or items may augment your natural roll. Initiative can neither exceed 100 nor fall below one, and ties will be broken randomly.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>4.4 In combat you will expend a resource called focus. Focus regenerates at a rate of one focus per hour without expending any. It remains until it is expended, up to the character's maximum as determined by the character creation rules in chapter 2.4.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>4.5 Damage can come from many sources. Sometimes a number will be specified, like a dagger causing 1d4 damage or a monster's claw dealing 2d6. Other times, The Auran will decide arbitrarily, like in the case of a player eating rotten fruit off a long abandoned plate. The Auran may decide circumstances merit an increase or decrease to damage, like if a player stuffs a lit torch into the mouth of a hostile elemental, an ice elemental will likely take more damage the case of a fire elemental. Damage reduction, like the kind associated with heavy and medium armor, means that every source of damage is reduced by that number. For example, a musket which does 1d10+2 damage when fired into a character in heavy armor will actually only do 1d10, because the +2 cancels out with the 2 damage reduction heavy armor affords. When damage is described as magic or magical, it means there is some special degree of Auran energy infusing it. This may cause arbitrary effects, but some are also predictable. Magic attacks work like normal against incorporeal creatures, and ignore the damage reduction trait of armor.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>4.6 Flying creatures may move in any direction, not just along the ground. Winged creatures require speed to stay airborn, and will safely glide to the ground at the end of their turn if they do not use all of their actions to move. Creatures which fly by other means may or may not be subject to this restriction.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>4.7 Should a creature fall uncontrollably from a great height, for example if a Skyspawn breaks their wing midair, they will take damage from falling. The amount of damage is equal to one for each five feet fallen minus one, for example no damage will be taken from falling five feet, and four damage will be taken from falling twenty-five feet.</p>
      
      <hr>
      <h2>Economy and Treasure</h2>
      <p>5.1 On your adventures, you may find many items including but not limited to those listed in the <a href="items.html">shop</a>. When adventuring, thieving, or looting a battlefield, The Auran decides what valuable objects may remain to be salvaged. Finding items in this way, buying them, or crafting them, are all ways to add items to your inventory. The items in your character's inventory are carried by you, and may be used creatively to solve problems or affect change.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>5.2 Equipment and treasure you find may encumber you. If any character carries more than 30 kilograms (kg) of items and gear, their movement speed will be halved from all nonmagical sources and they cannot fly with their wings. A kilogram is equal to about 2.2 pounds. If a character carries more than 50 kg, they must use two actions rather than one to move. Under normal circumstances, a character cannot carry more than 70 kg.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Items in Cradle are bought and sold with gold currency. The basic unit of currency is a gram of gold, referred to as a shaving. For comparison, this is about the weight of a paperclip. Some places may mint gold into pre-weighed coins for trade, some may mold it into rough pieces of equal size, and some may literally shave it and approximate the weight continuously. For very large purchases, gold may be measured in bars, which are equal to one kilogram or 1000 shavings. Because encumbrance is calculated in the imperial system for a predominantly U.S. American audience, the weight of gold shavings should be generally ignored and the weight of gold bars can be treated as two pounds.</p>
