    <h1>Lore</h1>
    <h2>The Origins of Cradle</h2>
    <p>The source of our tale, and the author of your destiny, are the Aurans. These gods (or at the very least godlike beings) exist outside our sense of reality, and the world of Ritual is a result of imagined stories they pass between each other. Unlike when humans gather to tell a story, Auran myths take on lives of their own and become very, very real to the characters in them. These characters are called Fatebound, and most play Ritual representing one of them while one represents The Auran who tells their part of the collective story. But how did these Fatebound come to be?</p>
    <p>At the beginning of time, the Aurans spoke of a sculpture made of four principle elements. Earth, air, fire, and water populated the vast emptiness and filled it with beauty. Then, the Aurans said, it was a great tragedy that reality was filled with such beauty but had no audience to experience it, so they took from themselves and birthed new life, mortal creatures which were to be called humans. These firstborn loved the world, and they named it Cradle. For Cradle, the aurans took more soul and spread life abundantly in the form of plants, animals, and all manner of growing things. The humans saw this creation, and loved it alongside their Auran parents, but they also feared it. The sharp teeth of wolves took many human lives in the deep woods, and living diseases claimed countless more. The humans asked the Aurans to teach them their language, so that they could spread and be joyous and abundant and safe forever. At first, the Aurans were happy to teach their Firstborn, but quickly they saw that humans could not be trusted with the power of creation. Mortal arcanists could not grasp the fullness of the Auran language, and dangerous mistakes were commonplace. Humans began to gather into towns, which became cities, nations, and empires. Wars broke out when friction arose between groups of mortals, and the language of creation was used by experts to kill warriors by the thousands. The Aurans realized that humans would destroy themselves if left to their own devices, so they wove new life out of the old elements of Cradle. The creatures who arose from this second age of creation, though bound to the nature of the element which spawned them, were very powerful. They were animated by ancient spirits of earth, air, water, and fire, which carried within themselves great power. The advent of these new species of humanoid created a new balance, and each species was taught the same simple connection to the Auran tongue as were the early humans, and each guarded the works of Cradle which they emerged from in harmony with the rest.</p>

    <h2>The Second Age</h2>
    <p>The second age of Cradle bore witness to a great peace. With their expansion halted by the sudden arrival of powerful Spawn, the Firstborn turned their attention inward toward their studies. For centuries, no more war or strife arose between mortal kind. You see, soul is the element of curiosity, and it was made to be so that those who bore it could find joy in coming to understand the nature of Cradle and the story which the Aurans desired to tell. The Firstborn developed giant cities and miraculous wonders of magical science from flying ships to miracle cure potions for every ailment. Despite the great strides, generation after generation of human was born wanting ever more. Eventually, humans desired to be like their Auran ancestors in every way, and sought to make their own Spawn. For decades the experiments led nowhere, and aside from horrified protests from the Spawn of the Aurans, few paid any mind to the undertaking which quietly dominated universities and circles of arcane study in human territory. No success was ever found in the making of a Soulspawn, the proposed derivation of soul in the same way that Earthspawn came from earth, Skyspawn from air, Seaspawn from water, and Flamespawn from fire, but the arrogant firstborn would not give up. One day, a simple experiment conducted in the quietude of a small coastal village bore life. A researcher at the University of Saltpeak, Stonewood, inscribed the Auran runes for "Child of my child, spawn of my soul" onto the skull of a still living fanatical volunteer, and killed them. The release of pure soul at the moment of death paired with a perfectly receptive vessel combined to create a new form of life, the first monster, an undead. This discovery sparked a new surge of research into the field of Soulspawn, but none among the humans realized that soul was not of the same essence of the first four elements, which were part of reality, but rather a piece of the Aurans themselves. The Aurans were disgusted to see how the Firstbone were using their gift of life, but did not interfere, for to them the horror was nothing more than a grim chapter in a long and complicated book.</p>
    <h2>The Third Age</h2>
    <p>Arcanists all around cradle began to make breakthrough after breakthrough in the study of Soulspawn. More and more twisted variations of humanoid wretches were created, many of which were allowed to reproduce freely and are now the most common monsters encountered to this day. True enough the humans recognized that their new spawn was violent and difficult to control, but they did not realize what they saw was a mere perversion of the gift of life. They toiled and strained at the confines of reality attempting to persuade the discarded spark of godhood to behave like the other humanoid spawn, civil and intelligent, but they failed each time. Their experiments grew more and more bold, the results more horrific, and the risks ever more profound. Everything changed when the Holy School for Auran Studies created a monster they could not contain, nor their nation's heroes, nor their nations armies. Ragnakar, the Cradle Shaker, combined the souls of one hundred human volunteers taken from hospice care and death row to be given a new form of life as the foundation of a massive Soulspawn. Ragnakar tore through the nations of men, long unprepared for war, and left a wake of broken schools and hedge wizard laboratories in his wake. Ravenous monsters spilled from every crack of civilization, haunting the dark streets of cities and patrolling the impossible stretches of wilderness. The combined might of the humans, Earthspawn, Skyspawn, Flamespawn, and Seaspawn was barely enough to keep the spark of civilization alive. Seeing what had become of their beautiful Cradle, the Aurans finally chose to intervene. They taught the foundations of a ritual which could be performed in lieu of simple speech, a spell of protection too complex for mortal tongues to mutter, which in time would be developed and interpreted in a million different ways by a thousand different cultures. This ritual kept the monsters far at bay, for the corrupted spirit of an Auran could not bear to be near the cleansing holy rite. In exchange for the knowledge of the sacred rite, humans would give up a portion of their soul to be scattered amongst all the spawn, and it would be replaced with a touch of each of their elements. This way, no more monsters could be created from living Firstborn. Gathered around scattered rituals like their forebears once gathered around flickering campfires for warmth and protection from the fears of the night, civilization found a new footing. Four thousand years later, this is where we set our scene. Monsters dare not profane the rites of civilization, but they have been left to gather and breed amongst themselves for millenia, and the world has become a frightening place indeed.</p>
    <h2>The Language of the Gods</h2>
    <p>Magic is the act and the result of speaking in the tongue of the Aurans. By adding to the story they tell, you fundamentally reshape the world around you. Anyone can do this in theory, but in practice the language of the gods is far too abstract and complicated for most to understand. It takes years of careful, diligent study to understand the basics of the Auran language, and even more to understand how to speak truth into the words. Most people write Auran down to perform magic, inscribing power into objects through written enchantment or preparing spells on scrolls. Reading Auran words of truth off of a vessel in reality will usually destroy it as too much raw power to be contained is channeled through, but the effects can be truly dazzling.</p>
    <h2>The Schools of Magic</h2>
    <p>Magic can be categorized according to its basic effects. Projections of raw energy and magic in its most basic form is evocation. Healing and growth magic are called vivimancy, and are practiced by druids. Protection and charms against intrustion are common forms of magic, in fact the school of magic associated with the ritual itself, and is called abjuration. Alchemy and the creation of new material is the school of magic used by the old animancers, the arcanists who created Soulspawn, and is called transmutation. Some magic cannot be categorized according to standard means, and is classified therefore as aberrant.</p>
    <h2>Forms of the Ritual</h2>
    <p>Though only one ritual was passed down directly from the Aurans, the millenia have given rise to many forms of the holy rite. Nomads and travelers often use natural materials and feeble structures to honor the gods, while the long standing fortresses of Earthspawn sommetimes dedicate entire greathalls to its maintenance and observance. The flamespawn practice a form of fire magic and feed new life with the ash of burned wood, but many human societies center their rituals around water. Modern Seaspawn tend not to employ any form of the ritual at all, as what few oceanic monsters there were have long since been hunted to near extinction. Nobody knows exactly what makes the ritual so effective even when split among its myriad forms, but everyone agrees it is the one thing which has kept civilization intact.</p>
    <h2>Imperial Marshalls</h2>
    <p>The Empire of Ardonia has led the charge in reclaiming Cradle from the monstrous scourge. In exchange for a steady tax and obedience to the emperor, scattered settlements across Cradle are protected by the Marshalls. The Ardonian Marshalls are an elite force of monster hunters who protect trade caravans, travelers, and other wayfarers as they move from ritual to ritual. Each territory of Cradle has about 1,000 Marshalls, which are vital to the survival of population centers too small or with not enough arable land to feed themselves.</p>
    <h2>Regions of Cradle</h2>
    <p>Cradle can be divided into Five primary regions, excluding the territory of the Seaspawn. In the Northwest lie the mountains of Mistveil, which are the native home of the Earthspawn. They have a flourishing industry of engineering and mechanics unrivaled even by the Seaspawn, which despite their scientific advancement struggle to produce reliable machinery underwater. To the East lies Ardonia, which is the human cultural capital of the world and home to the Ardonian Marshalls. South of that is Amberstreak, which is overrun almost entirely by monsters which could not even be imagined four thousand years ago. Further south still is the coastal region of Maiamatil, which employs a great wall against the terrors of the North but is otherwise a remarkably safe trade hub and center of academics. East again lie the tribes of Laramar, in which all kinds of spawn and Firstborn mingle in great nomadic sweeps across the fertile plains. The winged Skyspawn and unpredictable Flamespawn are scattered just as far and wide as the humans, but with notably less frequency.</p>
