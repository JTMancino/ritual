    <h1>Statement of Policy</h1>
    <p>Continued use of this site constitutes acknowledgment and acceptance as applicable of all stated policies.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This site is hosted on github pages, and user authentication as well as database management is run through Supabase. This site therefore inherits both of their privacy policies, as applicable. No information is collected about users outside of these functions. Your Supabase authentication account, associated with your email, is used to tie your identity to the characters you create so that you can access them later and to prevent others from accessing and altering characters you create without permission.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you would like to delete your account or any data associated with it, you may contact me at my personal email john.t.mancino@gmail.com. If I do not respond within a reasonable or convenient period, or if you prefer not to contact me directly, please contact Supabase for support.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>In no way are you to use this site or any of the resources it provides to attack, harass, bully, discriminate against, or otherwise violate the personal rights and freedoms of another person. You may not copy, download, or republish any element of this site or its resources without express written permission. You must avoid the use of real slurs (as distinct from those employed only fictionally in the Ritual mythos), hate speech against real people or groups, advocacy for real violence, or similarly dangerous intent in the character creator. The character creation tool and all associated databases are intended to create representations of fictional characters in the world of Ritual and should not be used for any other purpose.</p>
    <h2>Artificial Intelligence Policy</h2>
    <p>Some of the code used in the creation of this website was created with generative artificial intelligence large language model (LLM) tools. All code produced with LLM assistance has been manually reviewed by humans to ensure safety and security. Some or all images displayed on this website are made with generative artificial intelligence tools, and while the site remains free this will continue to be the case. No paid content will ever directly feature artificial intelligence artwork.</p>
